When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 When you want to share and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   So that i will always know what exactly i have in my local repository, rather than having it automatically update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork is when you copy a repository to and from GitHub. Clone is when copy from local repository and branches happen on a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that my local can be up-to-date with any changes that are made on GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

   Without Git or GitHub i would have to find other ways to communicate and collaborate with other; through e-mail and a storage provider like Dropbox.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

 I would make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master when i have some ideas, 
 but do not want to alter what is on master. If i do it this was way i can communicate with other and 
 see what they have to say about my ideas and if we should add it to master.
